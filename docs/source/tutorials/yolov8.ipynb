        "Since its [initial release back in 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640), the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family of computer vision models has been one of the most popular in the field. In late 2022, [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) announced [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/#ultralytics-yolov8), which comes with a new [backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08016#:~:text=Many%20networks%20have%20been%20proposed,before%20and%20demonstrates%20its%20effectiveness.).\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic YOLOv8 detection and segmentation models, however, are general purpose, which means for custom use cases they may not be suitable out of the box. With FiftyOne, we can visualize and evaluate YOLOv8 model predictions, and better understand where the model's predictive power breaks down.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this walkthrough, we will show you how to load YOLOv8 model predictions into FiftyOne, and use insights from model evaluation to fine-tune a YOLOv8 model for your custom use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, this walkthrough covers:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Loading YOLOv8 model predictions into FiftyOne\n",
        "* Evaluating YOLOv8 model predictions\n",
        "* Curating a dataset for fine-tuning\n",
        "* Fine-tuning YOLOv8 models\n",
        "* Comparing the performance of out-of-the-box and fine-tuned YOLOv8 models.\n",
